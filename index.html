            <p class="funParagraph">I joined boyscouts when I was 11 years old. Other than camping out in my backyard I had never went camping. Heck, excluding family vacations and nights at my grandparents I hadn't even spent a night away from home. But quickly, I grew to love spending time in the outdoors. Almost all my hobbies involve camping in some way. Even my other hobbies such as writing, drawing, photography are usually done when outdoors. Below, I plan on detailing some of the coolest trips I have taken and some future prospects for adventure.</p>

         <h3>Philmont Ranch New Mexico</h3>

            <p>My junior year of high school, 2012, I along with my fellow Boy Scouts of Troop 975 departed to Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico for my first true backpacking expierence. We would hike for 10 days. This adventure would include rock climbing, axe throwing, a game of "mountain ball" (a proto-baseball with its own country twist), scaling 3 mountains including the largest of the region Mount Baldy, horseback riding, horrible food, amazing views, and fantastic people.</p>

         <h3>Buffalo State Park in Arkansas</h3>
            <p>I took a break after aging out of Boyscouts from backpacking, but when I transferred to Truman State University in 2017 and found out there was a Backpacking club I was all in. TruOutdoors is where I would make some of closest friends, meet my girlfriend of five years, and my future roommates. The trip that cemented the foundation of these relationships was a weekend trip over Fall Break, where we went to Buffalo State Park in northern Arkansas. Despite the poor weather we had a great time, exploring a cave, hanging out on Goat Bluffs, and talking aroudn the campfire.</p>

            <h3>Washington and Jefferson National Forest in Virginia</h3>

            <p>The following semester, during Springbreak we would travel East to Virginia's Washington and Jefferson National Forest. It was an amazing trip, we had several foreign exchange students with us so it was great learning about their culture during the trip also. The trip included a minor medical emergency where my friend Gabe lost the tip of his thumb when he dropped a rock on it (reasoning for the rock being picked up is clasffied), but overall everyone had a great time. I think the highlight was wakign up at 3am to hike to the top of Devil's Lookout to watch the sunrise over the moutains. Though stopping by IHOP after a week of backpacking food was a close second.</p>

            <h3>Taos New Mexico</h3>

            <p>The next years spring break trip was out West to Taos New Mexico. A lower end piece of the Rocky Mountains, surrounded by wilderness and Native American Reservations. It was a bit unconvential of a trip due to last minute change ups, there was a bear attack on one of the trail segments we intended to spend 3 days on so we ended up spending time exploring the town more than we intended. This was during the outbreak of COVID too so things were begining to shut down across the country. But we visited a gorge similar to the Grand Canyon, hiked a trail knee deep in snow, bathed in a hot spring, visited a frozen waterfall, were probably witness to a large scale drug deal on the outskirts of town, and foudn a groupon for ice skating.</p>

            <h3>Bailey Colorado</h3>

            <p>After graduating, I kept in contact with many of the people in TruOutdoors. Together, we planned a trip to Bailey Colorado and did the Lost Creek Wilderness Loop. It was very challenging (I was still recovering from COIVD and was a bit out of shape) but still reach Buffalo Peak. We ended up taking a "shortcut" trail that was one of the most difficult and highest incline trails I've ever been on. There were times that we were just skampering up rocks, sliding on our butts down hills, and slept on a cliff side due to not being able to find a campsite in the dark. Afterwords, we hit the Coloardo Sand Dunes and had the best gas station pizza ever.</p>

            <h3>Zion, Bryce, and Grand Canyon + (Going Broke in Vegas)</h3>

            <p>The last trip I took in the Fall of 2023 was the Zion National Park. We flew into Las Vegas, lost fifty dollars, picked up our rental car and headed out. Zion was one of the most breathtaking views I've ever seen. We did many of the trails using the tram system ( I now know the struggle of being a sardine) and we spent our nights slightly outside of the park in a very pretty secluded spot. We did one of the most dangerous hikes in the USA, Angel's Landing in Zion which is maybe the most adrenaline pumping moments of my life. Afterwords we visited Bryce National Park, did several of the day hikes, adopted a prairie dog naming him Pedro, and slept the night away in a large Teepee. Afterwords we spent an afternoon at the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. We ended the trip with losing more money in Vegas, hitting up a 'gourmet' buffet, and staying in a wonderfully tacky casino hotel.</p>

         <h3>Great Smoky Mountains</h3>

            <p>My friends are planning a trip to the Great Smoky Mountains either this year or early spring next, which would help me check off another Natinional bucket list.</p>

            <h3>Yellowstone & Grand Teton</h3>

            <p>My girlfriend is currently doing a temporary field job in Wyoming. If I am able to find some time (maybe after graduating this course) I plan to go and visit her. We would like to see Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks and whatever else we can fit in the area.</p>

            <h3>Rocky Mountains</h3>

            <p>I have never camped more than a night by myself much less did a backpacking trip. But its something I've always wanted to try, so I had the idea doing the Rocky Mountain National Park trip solo. I have a few locations in mind but the one I'm most focused on is Skyline Trail, which is an isolated trail to the top of tallest mountain in the park. It's considered quite the challenge both mentally and physically atop of being a '14'er aka a mountain above 14,000 elevation. I'm wanting to start physical training for this trip (which will help and carry over to the others) this summer to help achieve this goal.</p>
